# Hardware Integration

The Baremetal IR OS interfaces directly with hardware components through a specialized Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that provides both efficiency and portability.

## Hardware Abstraction Layer

The HAL is structured in three tiers:
1. **Platform-Specific Layer**: Direct hardware access code for each supported platform
2. **Common Abstractions**: Unified interfaces for similar hardware components
3. **High-Level Services**: OS-level abstractions built on the lower layers

## Supported Architectures

The system currently supports:
- **x86-64**: Desktop and server systems
- **ARM64**: Mobile and embedded devices
- **RISC-V**: Open architecture platforms
- **Custom Hardware**: FPGA-based accelerators and specialized processors

## Driver Model

The driver architecture follows a modular design:
- **Core Driver Framework**: Common infrastructure for all drivers
- **Bus Drivers**: PCI, USB, I2C, SPI, etc.
- **Device Drivers**: Storage, network, display, input, etc.
- **Virtual Drivers**: Software-based device emulation

## Hardware Acceleration

The system leverages hardware acceleration for:
- **JIT Compilation**: Specialized instruction set extensions
- **Memory Management**: Hardware page tables and TLBs
- **Cryptography**: Hardware security modules
- **Graphics**: GPU acceleration for rendering
- **Networking**: Offloading packet processing to NICs

## Hardware Configuration

Hardware resources are configured through:
- **Static Configuration**: Pre-defined settings in system image
- **Discovery**: Runtime detection of hardware capabilities
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Adjustment based on workload requirements
