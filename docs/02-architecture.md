# System Architecture

The Baremetal IR OS uses a layered architecture with distinct components that work together to provide a complete operating system environment.

## Core Components

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- Provides direct interfaces to hardware components
- Implements platform-specific drivers and controllers
- Exposes a uniform API for higher-level components

### IR Runtime Environment
- Manages IR code loading and execution
- Handles memory allocation for IR code and data
- Implements garbage collection and resource management

### JIT Compilation Engine
- Translates IR code to native machine code
- Performs optimization passes based on runtime information
- Manages code caching and recompilation

### OS Services
- Provides process and thread management
- Implements file system abstractions
- Handles inter-process communication
- Manages security and access control

## System Flow

1. Boot sequence initializes hardware and core runtime
2. IR code is loaded from storage into memory
3. JIT compiler translates IR to optimized native code
4. Execution proceeds with dynamic optimization based on runtime conditions
