# Motivation

The development of the Baremetal IR OS was motivated by several key challenges in modern operating system design and implementation.

## 1. Traditional OS Limitations

Current operating systems face significant challenges:

1. **Performance Overhead**: Multiple abstraction layers introduce latency and resource consumption
2. **Hardware Compatibility**: Binary-level operating systems are tightly coupled to specific architectures
3. **Optimization Barriers**: Dynamic optimization is limited by predefined binary code structures
4. **Complexity**: Modern OS codebases have become increasingly complex and difficult to maintain

## 2. Our Solution Approach

The Baremetal IR OS addresses these limitations by:

1. **IR-Based Execution**: Using an intermediate representation allows for platform-agnostic code that can be optimized for any target hardware
2. **Direct Hardware Access**: Eliminating abstraction layers provides better performance and more precise control
3. **Dynamic Optimization**: The JIT compiler can apply optimizations specific to the current hardware and workload
4. **Simplified Architecture**: A clean-slate design focusing on essential functionality reduces complexity
