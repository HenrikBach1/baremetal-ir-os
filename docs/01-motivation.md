# Motivation

## Why IR-based Operating System?
Using an intermediate representation (IR) as the OS target increases portability, security, and flexibility in execution.

## Benefits
- ISA independence
- Potential for introspection and verification
- Delayed binding to hardware

## Challenges
- Bare-metal JIT complexity
- Performance overhead
- Hardware interfacing without native code
