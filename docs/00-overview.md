# Project Overview

The Baremetal IR OS is an innovative operating system that runs directly on hardware without requiring a traditional host operating system. It is built around a custom Intermediate Representation (IR) that serves as the foundation for all code execution through a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation engine.

## Development Methodology

This documentation follows a systematic three-phase engineering approach that reveals the complete development process:

### Phase 1: Analysis (Understanding the Problem)
The analysis phase examines the fundamental challenges in modern operating system design, establishes requirements, and studies existing solutions. This phase answers **"What problems are we solving and why?"**

- Problem identification and motivation
- Requirements analysis and constraints
- Comparative analysis of existing solutions
- Assumptions and design constraints

### Phase 2: Synthesis (Design and Architecture)
The synthesis phase transforms the analysis insights into concrete design decisions and architectural specifications. This phase answers **"How should we solve these problems?"**

- Design philosophy and principles
- System architecture and component design
- Interface specifications and protocols
- Integration strategies and patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation (Concrete Realization)
The implementation phase provides detailed technical specifications for building the system. This phase answers **"How do we actually build this?"**

- Concrete implementation strategies
- Code organization and structure
- Testing and validation approaches
- Performance optimization techniques

## Key Features

- **Hardware-level Integration**: Direct interaction with system hardware without an intermediary OS
- **Custom IR Architecture**: Platform-independent code representation for portability
- **JIT Compilation**: Dynamic code generation for optimal performance on various hardware
- **Minimal Runtime**: Efficient execution environment with minimal overhead
- **Extensible Design**: Modular architecture allowing for customization and expansion

## Target Applications

- Embedded systems requiring precise control over hardware resources
- High-performance computing environments with specific optimization needs
- Research platforms for operating system design and implementation
- Educational tools for understanding low-level system operations

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized to demonstrate professional engineering methodology, making it valuable not only as technical reference but also as an educational resource showing how complex systems are systematically designed and implemented.
