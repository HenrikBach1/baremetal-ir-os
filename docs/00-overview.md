# Project Overview

The Baremetal IR OS is an innovative operating system that runs directly on hardware without requiring a traditional host operating system. It is built around a custom Intermediate Representation (IR) that serves as the foundation for all code execution through a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation engine.

## 1. Key Features

- **Hardware-level Integration**: Direct interaction with system hardware without an intermediary OS
- **Custom IR Architecture**: Platform-independent code representation for portability
- **JIT Compilation**: Dynamic code generation for optimal performance on various hardware
- **Minimal Runtime**: Efficient execution environment with minimal overhead
- **Extensible Design**: Modular architecture allowing for customization and expansion

## 2. Target Applications

- Embedded systems requiring precise control over hardware resources
- High-performance computing environments with specific optimization needs
- Research platforms for operating system design and implementation
- Educational tools for understanding low-level system operations
