# OS Subsystem Design

The Baremetal IR OS provides essential operating system services through specialized subsystems, all built on the core IR execution environment.

## 1. Process Management

- **Process Model**: Lightweight process containers with isolated memory spaces
- **Thread Management**: Cooperative and preemptive multithreading
- **Scheduling**: Priority-based scheduling with real-time support
- **IPC Mechanisms**: Shared memory, message passing, and synchronization primitives

## 2. Memory Management

- **Virtual Memory**: Paging with hardware acceleration when available
- **Memory Protection**: Process isolation and privileged access control
- **Allocation Strategies**: Custom allocators optimized for different use cases
- **Garbage Collection**: Optional GC for managed memory regions

## 3. File System

- **Virtual File System**: Unified interface for various storage backends
- **Native File Systems**: Custom file systems optimized for specific storage media
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching for improved I/O performance
- **Journaling**: Transaction support for data integrity

## 4. Networking

- **Protocol Stack**: Modular implementation of network protocols
- **Socket API**: Standard interface for network communication
- **Zero-copy I/O**: Efficient data transfer without unnecessary copying
- **Hardware Offloading**: Support for network hardware acceleration

## 5. Device Management

- **Driver Framework**: Structured API for device driver implementation
- **Device Discovery**: Automatic detection and configuration of hardware
- **I/O Scheduling**: Prioritization of device access requests
- **Power Management**: Device power state control for energy efficiency

## 6. Security

- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permission system
- **Memory Safety**: Runtime checks and isolation mechanisms
- **Secure Boot**: Verification of system integrity during startup
- **Encryption**: Built-in support for data encryption
