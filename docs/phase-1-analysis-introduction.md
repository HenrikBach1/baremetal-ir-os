# Phase 1: Analysis - Problem Understanding and Requirements

Welcome to the **Analysis Phase** of the Baremetal IR OS documentation. This phase establishes the foundation for the entire project by thoroughly examining the problems we aim to solve, the requirements we must meet, and the constraints within which we must operate.

## Analysis Phase Objectives

The analysis phase serves several critical purposes:

1. **Problem Identification**: Clearly define the challenges in current operating system designs
2. **Requirements Elicitation**: Establish what our solution must accomplish
3. **Constraint Analysis**: Understand the limitations and boundaries we must work within
4. **Solution Space Exploration**: Examine existing approaches and their limitations

## Methodology

Our analysis follows a structured approach:

### Problem Domain Analysis
- Identify pain points in current operating systems
- Understand the root causes of these problems
- Quantify the impact and scope of issues

### Stakeholder Requirements
- Define functional requirements (what the system must do)
- Establish non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, etc.)
- Identify use cases and application scenarios

### Technical Constraints
- Hardware limitations and capabilities
- Performance requirements and trade-offs
- Compatibility and portability considerations

### Competitive Analysis
- Study existing solutions and their approaches
- Identify gaps and opportunities for innovation
- Learn from both successes and failures

## Outputs of Analysis Phase

By the end of this phase, we will have:

- **Clear Problem Statement**: Precisely defined challenges we're addressing
- **Requirements Specification**: Detailed list of what our system must accomplish
- **Constraint Documentation**: Known limitations and design boundaries
- **Solution Requirements**: Criteria for evaluating potential solutions

## Relationship to Subsequent Phases

The analysis phase directly informs:
- **Synthesis Phase**: Design decisions will be traced back to requirements
- **Implementation Phase**: Technical choices will be validated against constraints

This systematic approach ensures that every design decision and implementation detail can be traced back to a genuine need identified during analysis.
