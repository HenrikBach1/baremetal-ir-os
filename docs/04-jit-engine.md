# JIT Engine Design

The Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation engine is responsible for translating our IR code into native machine code at runtime, with optimization tailored to the specific execution environment.

## JIT Pipeline

The compilation process follows these stages:

1. **IR Loading**: Parse and validate IR code
2. **Analysis**: Gather statistics and identify optimization opportunities
3. **Optimization**: Apply IR-level transformations
4. **Code Generation**: Translate optimized IR to machine code
5. **Runtime Patching**: Update code based on execution data

## Optimization Techniques

### Static Optimizations
- Constant folding and propagation
- Dead code elimination
- Loop invariant code motion
- Strength reduction
- Inlining

### Dynamic Optimizations
- Speculative execution
- Profile-guided optimization
- Type specialization
- Deoptimization for exceptional cases

## Platform Adapters

The JIT engine includes pluggable backends for different architectures:
- x86-64
- ARM64
- RISC-V
- Custom hardware accelerators

## Memory Management

- Code section allocation with proper permissions
- Inline cache for polymorphic operations
- Garbage collection integration
- Hot/cold code splitting
