# Boot and Runtime Initialization

The Baremetal IR OS uses a specialized boot sequence to initialize hardware and establish the runtime environment for IR code execution.

## Boot Sequence

1. **Firmware Handoff**: Receive control from platform firmware (UEFI/BIOS)
2. **Hardware Detection**: Identify and initialize essential hardware components
3. **Memory Setup**: Establish memory map and initialize memory management
4. **Core Runtime**: Load and initialize the IR interpreter and JIT compiler
5. **System Services**: Start essential system services
6. **Initial Application**: Load and execute the initial system application

## Memory Layout

The system uses a carefully designed memory layout:

```
0x00000000 - 0x00FFFFFF: Reserved (Hardware, MMIO)
0x01000000 - 0x01FFFFFF: Boot code and data
0x02000000 - 0x0FFFFFFF: Kernel data structures
0x10000000 - 0x3FFFFFFF: JIT-compiled code cache
0x40000000 - 0x7FFFFFFF: Heap memory
0x80000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF: User application space
```

## Runtime Services

During boot, the following runtime services are established:

- **Memory Manager**: Handles allocation, deallocation, and garbage collection
- **Thread Scheduler**: Manages execution of concurrent threads
- **IO Manager**: Provides abstracted interfaces for device I/O
- **Exception Handler**: Processes hardware and software exceptions
- **Security Monitor**: Enforces access control policies

## Configuration Options

The boot process can be customized through:

- Command line parameters
- Boot configuration file
- Hardware-specific initialization modules
