# baremetal-ir-os

A research-driven project exploring the design and implementation of a **bare-metal OS** using a **custom intermediate representation (IR)** as its ISA. This IR is executed via a **JIT compiler** running directly on hardware, inspired by LLVM IR, WebAssembly, and Cranelift.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Define a portable, safe, and efficient IR for OS-level development
- Implement a JIT that runs directly on bare-metal and interprets the IR
- Build core kernel features (memory, syscalls, drivers) in IR
- Maintain transparency, verifiability, and modularity throughout
