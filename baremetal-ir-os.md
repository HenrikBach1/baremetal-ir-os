# Baremetal IR OS

## 1. Overview

The Baremetal IR Operating System (Baremetal IR OS) is a specialized operating system designed to run directly on hardware using an intermediate representation (IR) as its foundational execution model. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, design principles, and implementation details of the Baremetal IR OS.

## 2. Motivation

Traditional operating systems are designed with multiple layers of abstraction that can introduce overhead and complexity. The Baremetal IR OS aims to minimize these layers by:

1. Directly executing IR code on hardware
2. Eliminating unnecessary abstraction layers
3. Providing direct access to hardware resources
4. Optimizing for performance-critical applications

## 3. Architecture

The Baremetal IR OS architecture consists of the following core components:

- **IR Engine**: The heart of the system, responsible for executing the intermediate representation code
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Provides a unified interface to hardware components
- **Memory Management Subsystem**: Handles memory allocation, protection, and virtual memory
- **Scheduler**: Manages task execution and resource allocation
- **Device Drivers**: Interfaces with hardware peripherals
- **Runtime Services**: Provides essential system services and APIs

## 4. IR Design

The intermediate representation used in the Baremetal IR OS is designed to be:

1. **Hardware-agnostic**: The same IR code can run on different hardware platforms
2. **Optimizable**: The IR is designed to enable various optimization techniques
3. **Secure**: Built-in safety features to prevent common security issues
4. **Extensible**: New instructions and features can be added as needed

### 4.1. IR Instruction Set

The IR instruction set includes operations for:

- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Memory access and management
- Control flow
- System calls
- Vector operations
- Concurrency primitives

## 5. JIT Engine

The Just-In-Time (JIT) engine translates IR code to native machine code at runtime, providing:

1. **Performance**: Near-native execution speed
2. **Adaptability**: Can adjust to different hardware capabilities
3. **Optimization**: Runtime profile-guided optimizations
4. **Compatibility**: Supports various hardware architectures

## 6. Boot and Runtime

The boot process of the Baremetal IR OS follows these steps:

1. **Hardware initialization**: Basic hardware setup and self-tests
2. **IR engine initialization**: Loading and initializing the IR execution environment
3. **Memory setup**: Establishing memory management structures
4. **Device initialization**: Detecting and initializing hardware devices
5. **Runtime services startup**: Starting essential system services
6. **Application loading**: Loading and executing user applications

## 7. OS Subsystem Design
